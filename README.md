 ***Setup :***

- **Installing :**  Please install with:
```js
npm(yarn) install
``` 



- **Running the program :**
To run this server in your local setting, you will have to first create a Prisma account at: https://www.prismaio.com/

In the terminal, try to run:
```js
prisma init
```
You will most likely get an error message saying there might be a conflict with some files. The simplest way is to copy those files' contents, erase the file, and run 'prisma init' again. The files will re-emerge but empty. Paste the contents back into them.
Once done, please run:
```js
prisma deploy
prisma generate
```
This will create a service within your server and you can check out the database under the service tab.
You will also have to create a .env file in the project directory and add these variables with your own secrets:
```js
PORT = 4000
SENDGRID_USERNAME = ""
SENDGRID_PASSWORD = ""
JWT_SECRET = ""
AWS_KEY = ""
AWS_SECRET = ""
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = ""
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = ""
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER = ""
ADMIN_EMAIL = ""

PRISMA_ENDPOINT = "" (Please enter the 'http endpoint' you can find in your Service tab of your prisma account.)
```
**Enter your email for ADMIN_EMAIL and enter the 'http endpoint' you can find in your Service tab of your prisma account.**


You can start the server with:
```js
npm(yarn) run dev
```

If testing on localhost (ex:4000), navigate to localhost:4000 to check out the playground page where you can test the resolver functions.
